# game_of_life_frontend
This is an initial mockup of what the front end of an app that implements Conway's game of life might look like.


This app is built in React and the end goal will be to consume an API and animate [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  So far it has dummy data that is in no way a realistic simulation of the algorithm, but eventually I would like to develop the app to consume an API.  It is currently an 8x8 grid, but this may be expanded to a much larger grid.

The React is not the cleanest react I have ever written, but my goal was to get an MVP pushed out rather than write clean React.  If anyone has ideas for improving it, please don't hesitate to drop a PR.
